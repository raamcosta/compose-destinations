 * If declared as a parameter of a `@Destination` annotated Composable,
 * Compose Destinations will provide a correct implementation. If you're

 * [com.ramcosta.composedestinations.result.resultRecipient]
 * extension function to get a correctly typed implementation.
 *
 * Type safety related limitations (compile time enforced):
 * - [R] must be one of String, Boolean, Float, Int, Long, Serializable, or Parcelable.
 * They can be nullable.
 * - [R] type cannot have type arguments itself (f.e you can't use Array<String> even though it is Serializable)
 * - Each annotated Composable can have at most one parameter of type [ResultRecipient] for a given [TypedDestinationSpec] ([D])
 * - [D] destination Composable must have a corresponding [ResultBackNavigator] of the same type [R]
